# WAY - Where Are You? Server Repo

This repo contains the REST API code for WAY - Where Are You, a web app that lets users post their missing pets and connect with others through its forum page.\
Also consider taking a look at its frontend repo: [https://github.com/Ajnthony/whereareyou-client](https://github.com/Ajnthony/whereareyou-client)

I built the server with Python, Django, Django Rest Framework, Simple JWT and used OpenAPI/Swagger/ReDoc for documentation.
